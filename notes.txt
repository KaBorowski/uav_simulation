Ct calculation:

ME: 

Can you calculate for me Ct of the rotor?
Here are my rotor parameteres:
Voltage: 11.1 V
Current: 9.5 A
propeller: 1045
KV: 920
Power: 105 W
Efficiency 6.1 g/w
Pull (Thrust) generated by propeller in gramms: 642 g

To calculate the thrust coefficient (Ct) of your rotor, you can use the following equation:

Ct = T / (rho * n^2 * D^4)

where T is the thrust generated by the propeller in Newtons, rho is the density of the air in kg/m^3, n is the rotational speed of the propeller in revolutions per second, and D is the diameter of the propeller in meters.

To convert your thrust measurement from grams to Newtons, you can divide by 1000 to convert from grams to kilograms, and then multiply by the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2) to convert from mass to force:

T = (642/1000) * 9.81 = 6.30 N

Next, we need to calculate the rotational speed of the propeller (n) in radians per second. To do this, we can use the motor's KV value to relate the motor speed to the propeller speed:

n = KV * V / 60

where V is the battery voltage in volts. Plugging in the given values, we get:

n = 920 * 11.1 / 60 = 170.52 rad/s

Finally, we can plug in all the values to calculate the thrust coefficient:

Ct = 6.30 / (1.225 * 170.52^2 * (0.254)^4) = 0.042585

where we assumed a density of air (rho) of 1.225 kg/m^3. Therefore, the thrust coefficient of your rotor is approximately 0.042585.


Theta0: It represents the angle of attack of the blade section at the root of the propeller blade (where the blade meets the hub).
ThetaTip: It represents the angle of attack of the blade section at the tip of the propeller blade (farthest from the hub).
Theta1: It represents the angle of attack of the blade section located at 1/4 of the distance from the root to the tip of the blade.
Theta34: It represents the angle of attack of the blade section located at 3/4 of the distance from the root to the tip of the blade.


ME: 

I have following data:
Voltage: 11.1 V
Current: 9.5 A
propeller: 1045
KV: 920
Power: 105 W
Efficiency 6.1 g/w
Pull (Thrust) generated by propeller in gramms: 642 g

Using the given data, we can calculate the RPM of the propeller as follows:

Power = Voltage x Current
105 W = 11.1 V x 9.5 A

Thrust in Newtons = Pull in grams x 0.00981 / 1000
Thrust = 642 g x 0.00981 / 1000 = 0.0063 N

Using the formula P = 2πNT/60, where P is power in watts, N is propeller RPM, and T is thrust in Newtons, we can solve for N:

N = (60 x P) / (2π x T)
N = (60 x 105) / (2π x 6.3)
N = 159.1549 RPM

So the estimated RPM of the propeller with a 920kV motor and 1045 propeller is around 5287 RPM.
